### Hi there, I'm Emily. (she/her/hers)

I am currently a Web Design and Development student at Champlain College pursing an associate degree. I am seeking an internship opportunity, with or without the possibility of a career position, that will allow me to utilize my technical and design skills. I enjoy the ability to braid my critical thinking/analytic skills with creativity in the web design and development field. I'm also very passionate about Accessibility and Inclusive design.

I am equally comfortable working with teams in an open collaborative environment as well as take initiative and work solo while framing challenging problems and meeting deadlines.

My professional, educational, and personal background is eclectic which uniquely positions me to bring my experience with research, writing, teaching, public speaking, team leading and working on teams, networking, consulting, and organizing skills to my work in the computer science field. 

My early work in the IT/Computer Science field began with learning Boolean searching, Basic, and C++. I am comfortable working on various operating systems, have the ability to pick up new technologies quickly and I am always excited about learning new languages and frameworks.
